### Disclaimer
The following repository is one of the few malware collections on GitHub.

Incorrect use of the samples provided may lead to irreversible damage, such as **personal data leaks**, **device inoperability**, **data loss**, and much, much more.

### Introduction
Most people claim *¬´malware samples aren't toys¬ª*, but I believe game is a form of active learning, and it's important to be cybersecurity educated. Tinkering with malware in a controlled environment with necessary precautions taken is fun! :wink: People who think otherwise must simply be afraid of it. Nevertheless, it's still recommended to have **advanced computer knowledge** before dealing with malware in general. **Any type of *educated* question is welcome, but belongs to the issues. Submit an issue and have me answer it some time later.**

# FAQ

### Here you can find answers to frequently asked questions. This may be helpful if you're a newcomer!
‚ùì The archive is password-protected. What's the password?  
üí° The password is **mysubsarethebest** verbatim. In fact, you probably [scrolled past it](#password) without noticing...

‚ùì I am 100% sure I did not mistype the password when opening/extracting the archive, however it *still* doesn't accept the password, what's the deal?  
üí° Check for any mistakes once again to be 101% sure, and if the issue is indeed on my side *(we're all human!)*, do notify me by creating an issue! I will make sure to reupload the sample with the right password.

‚ùì The sample I absolutely loved you reviewed on YouTube isn't in this repository, why's that?  
üí° The malware series are back, although I cannot guarantee the presence of every sample reviewed on my channel. Create an issue if you don't find a sample you really want, I (or my moderator) will help you shortly after. But please, please don't spam with your requests in issues. Send them to my mailbox. (mentioned in the 4th question)

‚ùì Can I contribute to your malware database? If yes, how?  
üí° Of course. You can send malware submissions directly to my [mailbox](#contact)! The malware you made yourself has to be **well made and well thought-through**, it has to be original and have artistic value. Only the cream of the crop will be reviewed and uploaded into this repository.

‚ùì **WHERE IS SOLARIS?**  
üí° The original creator of the malware **nikitpad** does not want the sample to be shared online. I respect her decision, and so should you. Please don't be a leech and bother me or her about Solaris.
